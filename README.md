## About Me
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @liz-mcdaneld and Data analyst with a background in Fire and EMS. Certificate in Data Analysis from Rice Universityâ€™s Bootcamp. Skills include excellent team-work and team-building from experience as a firefighter allowing me to work proficiently in a team and with collaborations. Achievements include instructor certificate in AAIR (Active Attack Integrated Response) for ALERRT(Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training), and Creative Director for Warriorâ€™s Way Foundation. Self motivated with constant desire to learn. Excited about using my skills in data analytics to perform detailed and efficient analysis. Strengths include attention to detail, creativity, critical thinking and problem solving to perform organized quality analysis.

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested becoming a team member with a company who values thier employees, and where I can apply my creativity and skills. 

- ðŸŒ± I have studied data analysis with Rice University Bootcamps. Through this program I am learning many different skills used in data analysis. I have done Pivot tables, Forecasting, VBA scripting, and Statistics modeling through Microsoft Excel. Python data analytics using Python 3, APIs, NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Organizing and structuring data with SQL, PostgreSQL/pg, Admin, MongoDB, and Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process. Web visualization through HTML, CSS, Bootstrap framework, JavaScript charting, and Geo mapping with Leaflet.js This program also covers advanced topics like Tableau, R programming, Hadoop, and Machine learning.

#### Project Goals and Purpose

The Greater Houston Area is a large portion of Southeast Texas consisting of 17 counties, and with an estimated population of 7.21 million. The goal is to look at documented crimes from 2015 to 2020 and their statistics to see how the years, counties, and other factors compare and what factors may determine the crime numbers for different counties. Our analysis looks at an overview of all Texas counties, with a focus on Harris County and the Greater Houston area.
